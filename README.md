## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will require node.js to run this node module.

### Installation

Create a file called "app.js" within the installation folder.

Add `const pharmahelper = require("./Aurelius_EGL301.js");` at the very top of the file.

To utilise module functions, call them by using "pharmacy.(function)".

A few examples would be

    - pharmahelper.createInventoryReport

All functions can be found within the module itself, along with comments explaining them.

Run the program by using the "node app.js" command in the terminal.
